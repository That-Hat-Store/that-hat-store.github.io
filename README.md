# Welcome!
This is the repo we store our website on.

# Why is this on github?
We use github to store our website because we are too poor to use big corporations like Shopify, GoDaddy, and Squarespace.

# Can I fork this website?
Yes, but we want credit for building the website. Look in the copyright policy down below for more information.


## Copyright policy
We ask that you do not copy any designs on the website (Logo, Hat mockups, Hat design, Pictures etc). We work hard on making these things. We also ask that you do not use our mailing form, because if you do, you will mess sonthing up, and probably make our customer support go on strike. You can copy the website structure.
